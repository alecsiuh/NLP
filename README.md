# Experimenting with Natural Language Processing

This repository contains 4 different Jupiter Notebooks that contain various ways of using the SpaCy library.

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subset of artificial intelligence, computer science, and linguistics focused on making human communication, such as speech and text, comprehensible to computers. 

NLP is used in a wide variety of everyday products and services. Some of the most common ways NLP is used are through voice-activated digital assistants on smartphones, email-scanning programs used to identify spam, and translation apps that decipher foreign languages.

SpaCy is designed specifically for production use and helps you build applications that process and “understand” large volumes of text. It can be used to build information extraction or natural language understanding systems, or to pre-process text for deep learning.

## In these notebooks you can find
#### NLP_1 and NLP_1_b
- experimenting with the SpaCy features, based on the SpaCy tutorials
#### NLP_2
- how to find the most similar text from a collection of texts with the one you've inserted in the input
#### NLP_3
- how to build a summarizer for any text
